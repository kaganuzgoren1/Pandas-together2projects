# Pandas-together2projects
There are two projects. The first is a beginner-level project, and the second one is an advanced-level project. For the first project, "Pokemon" data is used. The second project uses the "Sales" data. The second project aims to create more sense from the given data and to answer written questions in the projects. Pandas library is used for these projects.
